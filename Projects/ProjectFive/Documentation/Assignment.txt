You are to code "zyDE 13.1.1" in NetBeans changing the part of the compareTo()
method in the EmployeeData.java class so that it 

compares emplIDs rather than name.


You are also to remove the entire do loop code block and replace it with code that will
read in the employee data from a file (so there is no menu to add, print, or quit...
simply read in data and sort the records and output). 

The data file is included in the Content folder for the week. 

You will use the Project Assignment Template file to create a Word Processing document for submitting your work 
(template file also in the Content folder for the week). 

You will name your Project Assignment Document as "yourlastname-CST141FA23-ProjectForW08" as either a .doc, .docx, or .pdf.
Ex. Smith-CST141FA23-ProjectForW08. 

Submit the file under the Project for Week 08 Assignment folder in BrightSpace. The assignment is due by 11:59PM on
10/29.Sunday, / 11:59PM.
