You are going to modify the program 

"Figure 15.10.1: A seat reservation GUI involving a table, fields, and buttons."


The first task is to create a project in NetBeans called

ProjectWeek11 but you will call the main class "SeatReservationFrame". 

Copy and paste the "SeatReservationFrame.java" source code into the editor without erasing the package statement. 

Create a second java file in the same package called "SeatInfo".

Copy and paste the "SeatInfo.java" source code into the editor for SeatInfo without erasing the package statement. 

Compile and get the program to run. 

Analyze the source code, the description of the program in the textbook section, and observe the interactions with the program.


Modifications:

1. Adjust NUM_SEATS value, swap table_size variable to use NUM_SEATS, check it works

Requires: Change NUM_SEATS to 20; Table Size should use NUM_SEATS ( (rather than) not the original value of 5)

Notes: 
Ensure that it works with the new value and the screen interface changes



2. Follow the details in " Try 15.10.1: Modify the above GUI." 
Requires: Modify the SeatReservationFrame program to have an additional JFormattedTextField and JButton component 
For Purpose: Deleting a particular seat reservation. 

Notes: 
Within JFormattedTextField component, user can enter seat number, on JButton activation -> trigger deletion


3. Add Method, Ensure Invocation is correct, 

Requires: Adding new method 
Method reads values of certain seats
Method makes the initial reservation

Notes:
Ensure that the invocation is in the appropriate place to the load the table with the values read in

Add a method that will read the values of certain seats and will make initial
reservations. Add the invocation in the appropriate place to load the table
with the values read in. The program should then work as it currently does.
A text file will be provided to test your program.
