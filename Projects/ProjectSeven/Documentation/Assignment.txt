Copy the JavaFX template project into a new project called ProjectWeek13 and
refractor-rename the main class Conversions.


Create a JavaFX interface that 

Form

converts distances from US measurements 
(4 different fields for miles, yards, feet, and inches with 4 buttons)
to metric (at least 2 different conversion values in separate, labeled fields). 

Below that in the same form 

converts weights 
either (tons, pounds, ounces) from US weights to metric
(at least two different values). 


create a section of the form to 
convert volumes from US volumes
(gallons, cups, tablespoons, and teaspoons) to metric (two values). 

Allow the user to enter decimal amounts of each value to be converted.

BONUS:
Allow the user to select the type of measure with a radio button for each section to
match what is in the parenthesis rather than separate input fields and buttons for each
type of measurement (distance, weights, and volume).
